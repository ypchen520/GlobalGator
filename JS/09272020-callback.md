# Callback
* ```A function```
  * that is to be executed after another function has finished executing
* In JS
  * __functions are objects__
  * functions can
    * take functions as arguments: __higher-order function__
      * any function that is *passed as an argument* is called a __callback function__
    * be returned by other functions
  * event driven language
    * does not do: waiting for a response before moving on
    * does do: *keep executing while listening for other events*
  * setTimeout
    * *calls a function after a set amount of time*
*__Callback is a way to make sure certain code doesn't execute until other code has already finished executing__
* Create a callback
  * define the callback function in the higher-order function call
    * function FUNC(PARAM1, callback){...}
    * FUNC(PARAM1, function() {...});
  * define the callback function elsewhere in the code
    * function FUNC(PARAM1, callback){...}
    * function FUNC_cb(){...}
    * FUNC(PARAM1, FUNC_cb);
* Real-world example (Twitter)
```javascript
T.get('', params, function(err, data, response){
  if(!err){ 
    //DO SOMETHING 
  }else{
    console.log(err);
  }
});
```
